# Python_Challenge
This repository shows a real-world application where I can use the skills learned in Python. 
# PyBank
PyBank shows how to analyze financial records of a company. The financial data set budget_data.cvs was provided.
This Pytho script analyzes the records to calculate the following:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits ( date and amout) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll
PyPoll is an example of how I can modernize a small rural towns vote-counting process. The data set election_data.csv was given. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID","County", and "Candidate". 
This Python script analyzes the votes and calculates the following:
1. The total number votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote
